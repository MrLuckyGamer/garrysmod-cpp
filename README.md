# garrysmod-cpp
The public Garry's Mod C++ interface. Contains a custom C++ standard library, proxy class around LuaJIT's lua_State, and headers for GMod's lua libraries and types (those loadable from gmod.LoadLib in the Lua interface).

Requires C++20 for building.

**This is currently in development and cannot be compiled. Please give suggestions/feedback in the #cpp channel of the Garry's Mod Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gmod**
